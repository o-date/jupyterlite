# Project Ideas

A collection of potential projects and their connections to research and notes.

## Digital Humanities Projects

### 1. Text Analysis Pipeline
- Build on [[research-methods]] for systematic approach
- Connect with [[notes]] on data processing
- Reference [[analysis.ipynb]] for implementation
- Use [[sample-data.csv]] for testing

### 2. Knowledge Graph Visualization
- Visualize connections between [[notes]]
- Show relationships found in [[meeting-notes]]
- Build on concepts from [[research-methods]]
- Document progress in [[2024-01-15]] style entries

### 3. Collaborative Research Platform
- Integrate findings from [[research-methods]]
- Support multiple [[notes]] formats
- Enable sharing of [[meeting-notes]]
- Reference architecture in [[config.json]]

## Implementation Ideas

### Technical Stack
- Use findings from [[research-methods]]
- Document in [[notes]] format
- Track progress in daily entries like [[2024-01-15]]
- Store configuration in [[config.json]]

### Data Sources
- Research datasets like [[sample-data.csv]]
- Analysis notebooks such as [[analysis.ipynb]]
- Meeting outputs from [[meeting-notes]]
- General observations in [[notes]]

## Next Actions

1. Review [[research-methods]] for methodology
2. Update [[notes]] with implementation details
3. Schedule discussion for [[meeting-notes]]
4. Create daily log entry like [[2024-01-15]]
5. Return to [[start]] for overview

Each project connects multiple knowledge areas - use the backlinks panel (Alt+B) to see these connections!
