# Research Methods

Systematic approaches to research and knowledge management, referenced throughout the [[start]] ecosystem.

## Qualitative Methods

### Note-Taking Systems
- Maintain central [[notes]] repository
- Use daily entries like [[2024-01-15]] for reflection
- Connect ideas through wikilinks
- Document meetings in [[meeting-notes]]

### Knowledge Organization
- Start with overview in [[start]]
- Develop specific topic areas like [[project-ideas]]
- Cross-reference related concepts
- Build networks of connected thoughts

## Quantitative Methods

### Data Analysis
- Store datasets as [[sample-data.csv]]
- Create analysis notebooks like [[analysis.ipynb]]
- Document methodology in [[notes]]
- Track results in [[project-ideas]]

### Configuration Management
- System settings in [[config.json]]
- Document processes in [[notes]]
- Reference in [[meeting-notes]]
- Connect to [[project-ideas]]

## Mixed Methods Approach

### Integration Strategy
1. Combine qualitative [[notes]] with quantitative data
2. Use [[meeting-notes]] to discuss findings
3. Develop [[project-ideas]] based on results
4. Document everything for future reference

### Validation Techniques
- Cross-reference between [[notes]] and data
- Peer review through [[meeting-notes]]
- Iterative development of [[project-ideas]]
- Regular reflection in daily entries like [[2024-01-15]]

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Maintain clear [[notes]] on methodology
- Reference data sources like [[sample-data.csv]]
- Update [[project-ideas]] with findings
- Archive decisions in [[meeting-notes]]

### Reproducibility
- Version control through [[notes]]
- Clear documentation in [[analysis.ipynb]]
- Configuration tracking via [[config.json]]
- Process documentation for [[project-ideas]]

## Tools and Technologies

The PKM extension supports this methodology by:
- Linking concepts across [[notes]]
- Connecting to data files like [[sample-data.csv]]
- Integrating with notebooks such as [[analysis.ipynb]]
- Enabling quick navigation from [[start]]
